    <h1>History of The Democratic Republic of Ramona</h1>
  <img src="ramonaflag.webp" alt="Flag" style="width: 40%;" > 
  <p>The Democratic People's Republic of Ramona was formed on the 22nd of August, 2024.
  We are a peaceful socialist micronation, planning on becoming an Empire. 
  The Republic of Ramona is lead by our incredibly powerful leader Ramona,
  who established our empire, giving it the name Republic of Ramona.
  The Republic of Ramona flag was created before the offical establishment of our empire,
  and has been edited and updated 1 time since (20th Febuary 45^2). Ramona, our leader also created a pledge of allegiance which is as follows - 
  "I pledge allegiance to the Republic of Ramona, one nation, united in freedom and harmony. 
  I vow to upload its values of justice, equality, and compassion, and protect all its citizens. 
  For the Republic of Ramona, now and forever."
